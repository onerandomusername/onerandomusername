# Hey, I'm Me
I go by a lot of names online. If you found this page from my website, or I gave you my GitHub in person, you know what I like to be called. 

If you don't know, you can call me arl.

My pronouns are she/her.

My current projects are Eos and ETCnomad related, as I'm creating a project to make some third party ETCnomad keyboards be more stable and reliable.

I'm also working on a project to be an accurate Network Time Server on isolated networks such as lighting networks. You can find the source code for that at [ProtoTime](https://gh.arielle.codes/ProtoTime).

I'm currently working on learning how to CAD, because why not...
